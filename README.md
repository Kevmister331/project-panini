Project Panini is a web-based React application that harnesses OpenAI API to generate project ideas that are catered to your interests. Project Panini also serves as a project dashboard for hackers like us to manage all your ideas and track their respective progress. 

You begin by entering keywords separated by commas, and the AI will produce 5 curated project ideas that fuse the different user inputs together. After you have decided on a project you like, you'll be taken to your project dashboard where you can view the chosen project in greater depth, with suggested tasks laid out in order to guide you to the completion of the project. Additionally, your other active projects will be listed along the left side of the screen where they are easily accessible. Your progression through projects is tracked by a unique progress bar for each project, where checking off tasks will increase the advancements.
